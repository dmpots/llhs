	Exit:
		Goes to evaluate the dictionary and finds it not evaluted.
		The code for evaluating the dictionary just does inc and return so it never gets evaluated.
		Pushes 0x000000000407e80(sPe) onto the stack which is the code that extracts the + function,
		ensures that it is evaluted and then calls stg_ap_pp.
		The trace should jump directly here, but the dictionary never gets marked as evaluated 
		so we always go through the jump+inc+return to sPe (0x407e80)
	--> ibl (sPe == 0x407e80, Trace 199 could deduce that from the trace)
