This is the chamenoes from ghc 6.12 that actually ran faster under dynamorio,
although it had some odd behavior.

This is very odd redirecting the stdout has a big effect on running time when
going through dynamorio, but not when executing natively

$ time ./chameneosredux 6000000
real  0m8.110s
user  0m8.099s
sys 0m0.011s

$ time ./chameneosredux 6000000 > _T
real  0m8.042s
user  0m8.035s
sys 0m0.007s

$ time /home/dave/dr/bin/drrun ./chameneosredux 6000000
